    * added D-Stream (with attraction)
    * improved support for creating animations
    * tnn: new decay models, tNN without shared density now reclusters 
        using density reachability
    * plot gained the type "both" that plots micro and macro-clusters
    * DSC_Hierarchical and DSC_Kmeans gained min_weight to filter low weight
        micro-clusters before reculstering
    * removed default radius, etc. for most clustering algorithms
    * DSC_DenStream does now internally recluster using density reachability
