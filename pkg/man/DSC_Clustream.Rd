\title{DataStreamClusterer: Clustream}
\description{Creates a new DataStreamClusterer with the Clustream algorithm}

\usage{
DSC_Clustream(timeWindow = 1000, maxNumKernels = 100)
}

\arguments{
  \item{timeWindow}{Defines the time window to be used in Clustream}
  \item{maxNumKernels}{Defines the maximum number of kernels used in Clustream}
}

\details{
Clustream was originally introduced in Aggarwal's paper cited below. 
Like most data stream clustering algorithms, Clustream summarizes the 
incoming data points into micro-clusters. At any given time, it can be 
assumed there are q micro-clusters maintained by Clustream. This means 
that when a new micro-cluster is created, another one must be deleted, 
and the opposite is true for when two micro-clusters merge with one 
another. A significant amount of thought in Clustream is given to the 
temporal structure of data streams. Snapshots of calculated micro-clusters 
are stored in a "pyramidal time frame" pattern. This allows the user to 
turn back to a specific location in the data stream to mine information 
from a particular time period.

The \code{timeWindow} parameter changes the granularity at which the snapshots 
are taken for the micro-cluster summary maintanence. \code{maxNumKernels} 
is analogous to the q micro-clusters that are maintained within the algorithm.
