\title{DataStreamClusterer: DenStream}
\description{Creates a new DataStreamClusterer with the DenStream algorithm}

\usage{
DSC_DenStream(horizon = 1000, epsilon = 0.1, minPoints = 10, beta = 0.001, mu = 1, initPoints = 100, lambda = NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{horizon}{Range of the (time) window.}
  \item{epsilon}{defines the epsilon neighborhood in which the density of each micro-cluster is calculated (i.e.,
  the radius).}
  \item{minPoints}{minimum number of points a micro-cluster must have.}
  \item{beta}{the outlier threshold, used in conjunction with \code{mu}
  (range: 0 to 1)} \item{mu}{the minimum weight a micro-cluster must have
  within the \code{epsilon} neighborhood (range: 0 to max(double))}
  \item{initPoints}{number of points to use for initialization}
  \item{lambda}{number used to override computed lambda}
}

\details{
DSC_DenStream is based on the DenStream algorithm. DenStream is a density
based clustering algorithm that summarizes the incoming data points into
micro-clusters based upon the frequency of data points in a particular
location within a defined boundary (i.e., their density). DenStream
includes a fading function that causes the weight of data points to
decrease exponentially as t increases. This means that temporal structures
within the data stream are also visible using this algorithm. 

The creators of DenStream use a dbscan variation to recluster the
micro-cluster into the final clustering.
