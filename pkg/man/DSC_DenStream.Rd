\title{DataStreamClusterer: DenStream}
\description{Creates a new DataStreamClusterer with the DenStream algorithm}

\usage{
DSC_DenStream(epsilon = 0.1, minPoints = 10, lambda = 0.006, beta = 0.001, mu = 1, initPoints = 1000)
}

\arguments{
  \item{epsilon}{-e (defines the epsilon neighborhood, range: 0 to 1)}
  \item{minPoints}{-p (min. num. points a cluster must have)}
  \item{lambda}{-l (range: 0 to 1)}
  \item{beta}{-b (range: 0 to 1)}
  \item{mu}{-m (range: 0 to max(double))}
  \item{initPoints}{-i (number of points to use for initialization)}
}

\details{
DSC_DenStream is based on the DenStream algorithm. DenStream is a density 
based clustering algorithm that summarizes the incoming data points into micro-clusters 
based upon the frequency of data points in a particular location within a defined boundary 
(i.e., their density). DenStream includes a fading function that causes the weight of 
data points to decrease exponentially as t increases. This means that temporal structures 
within the data stream are also visible using this algorithm. 

The parameters are defined as follows:
epsilon: refers to the neighborhood in which the density of each micro-cluster is calculated (in other words, the radius).

minPoints: is the minimum number of points a micro-cluster must have.

lambda: alters the fading function: the larger \code{lambda}, the lower the weight of the historic data.

beta: is the outlier threshold, and is used in conjunction with \code{mu}

mu: the minimum weight a micro-cluster must have within the \code{epsilon} neighborhood

epsilon: the neighborhood to be considered a core-micro-cluster (as opposed to an outlier or a potential-micro-cluster).

initPoints: is the number of data points to initialize the algorithm with.
