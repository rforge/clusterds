\title{Clustering data based with input algorithm and data stream}

\description{
Clusters a number of input points from a data stream into a clustering object.
}

\usage{
cluster(dsc, dsd, n = 1)
}

\arguments{
  \item{dsc}{a DSC object}
  \item{dsd}{a DSD object}
  \item{n}{number of points to cluster}
}

\details{
Clusters input data. The underlying clustering in the DSC object is implicitly updated
as if the object was `passed by reference' in a traditional programming language.

The data points from the DSD object will be extracted one at a time. Although this operation
is slower, it always allows the clustering of \code{n} to infinity data points, as long as
the underlying stream clustering algorithm is capable of summarizing \code{n} amount of
data points.
}

\value{
The updated DSC object is returned invisibly for reassignment. To obtain the updated
clustering result, call \code{get_centers()} upon the DSC object.
