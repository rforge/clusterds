\description{Clusters a number of input points from a data stream into a clustering object.}
\usage{
cluster(dsc, dsd, n = 1000)
}
\arguments{
  \item{dsc}{a DSC object}
  \item{dsd}{a DSD object}
  \item{n}{number of points to cluster}
}
\details{
  Clusters input data. The underlying clustering in the DSC object is implicitly updated
  as if the object was 'passed by reference' in a traditional programming language.
}
\value{ The updated DSC object is returned invisibly for reassignment. }
