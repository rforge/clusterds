\title{Represent the Results of a Clustering in a Static Form}
\description{
    This representation cannot perform clustering anymore, but it
    also does not need the supporting data structures. It only stores
    the cluster centers and weights.
    }

\usage{
	DSC_Static(macroclusters = NULL, microclusters = NULL, weights = NULL)
}

\arguments{
	\item{macroclusters}{The centers of the macroclusters.}
	\item{microclusters}{The centers of the microclusters.}
	\item{weights}{The weights of the centers.}
}

\details{
This DSC is generated by \code{merge_DSC} and \code{prune_clusters}. This allows for the evaluation
of the results of the previous methods. Unlike other \code{DSC}s, however, clustering cannot be performed.
Once it has been generated it cannot change.
}

\value{
A list of class \code{DSC}, \code{DSC_R}, and \code{DSC_Static}. The list also contains either
 \code{DSC_Micro} or  \code{DSC_Macro} depending on what type of DSC was used to create it. The list
contains the following items:

	\item{description}{The name of the algorithm in the DSC object.}
	\item{RObj}{The underlying R object.}
}

\examples{
# 3 clusters with 5% noise

# prune the data and collect the DSC_Static
dsc_static <- prune_clusters(dsc)
